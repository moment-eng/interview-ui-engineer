# Moment Interview (UI Engineer)

This is a starter repo that has a couple versions of Create React App ready to go,
which will hopefully save you a little bit of time. `/create-react-app` contains
a base react app, whereas `./create-react-app-with-tailwind` comes with Tailwind
preconfigured. Use whichever you're most comfortable with, including just starting
from scratch if you prefer.

In either case, run `npm install` then `npm start` to start the development environments.

Both repos have [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios) and
[React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) installed, but again--
use what is most comfortable for you.

You are welcome to use any UI / component libraries as a base if you would like,
as long as you demonstrate how you'd customize these libraries beyond the defaults
provided.

Any other questions? Just ask!
